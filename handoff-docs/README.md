# Project Pivot Handoff — JusticeQuest → OpenHands (Single‑Tenant Model)

This handoff explains how we got here, the project’s ultimate goal, what the current Laravel integration does, and why we’re pivoting to a single‑instance‑per‑customer model where we own an OpenHands fork tailored to legal workflows.

Audience: new engineers joining the effort
