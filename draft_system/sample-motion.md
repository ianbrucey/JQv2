### IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION

IAN BRUCE,

Plaintiff,

v.

HAPPY MONEY, INC.,

Defendant.

Civil Action File No. 1:24-cv-05027-SDG

---

### PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO LIFT STAY, FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT, AND FOR SANCTIONS

Plaintiff Ian Bruce, proceeding pro se, respectfully moves this Court to lift the stay on this action, grant him leave to file the attached Proposed Amended Complaint, and issue sanctions against Defendant Happy Money, Inc. for its bad-faith conduct. This motion is based on Defendant’s default and failure to comply with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), which resulted in the termination of the arbitration proceedings.

### BACKGROUND

1. On Defendant’s motion, this Court entered an order on April 2, 2025, compelling the parties to arbitration and staying this case pending the outcome.
2. Plaintiff proceeded in good faith, filing a Demand for Arbitration and engaging in settlement negotiations with Defendant
3. On August 8, 2025, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve this matter.
4. Despite this agreement, the deadline for Defendant to pay its required portion of the arbitration fees passed on August 11, 2025, without payment from Defendant.
5. On August 19, 2025, the AAA issued a closing letter, terminating the arbitration due to Defendant’s non-compliance. A true and correct copy of this letter is attached as Exhibit A.

### ARGUMENT

I. The Stay Should Be Lifted Because Defendant Defaulted on the Arbitration.

This Court’s stay was contingent upon the parties’ participation in arbitration. By refusing to pay the required fees, Defendant has defaulted on its obligation and materially breached the arbitration agreement. Because the arbitration has been terminated solely due to Defendant’s failure to comply, the basis for the stay no longer exists, and the case should be reopened.

II. The Court Should Grant Leave to File an Amended Complaint.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides that courts should “freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” An amendment is necessary to include claims that have developed since the original filing, including a claim for Defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement. Defendant cannot claim prejudice, as the return to this Court was caused by its own default. The Proposed Amended Complaint is attached as Exhibit B.

III. The Court Should Sanction Defendant for its Bad-Faith Conduct.

This Court has the inherent authority to sanction parties for bad-faith litigation conduct. Defendant engaged in such conduct by first compelling Plaintiff out of this public court and into a private forum, only to then refuse to pay the fees necessary for that forum to proceed. This tactic wasted the time and resources of both the Plaintiff and the AAA and unreasonably delayed the resolution of this case. Plaintiff requests that the Court sanction Defendant by awarding Plaintiff the monetary value of his time and costs wasted on the failed arbitration process.

### CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Ian Bruce respectfully requests that the Court enter an order lifting the stay, granting leave to file the Proposed Amended Complaint, and granting sanctions against the Defendant.

Respectfully submitted, this 20th day of August, 2025.
