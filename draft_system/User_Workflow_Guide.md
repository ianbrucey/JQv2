## **Switching Between Modes**

### **You Can Switch Modes Anytime**
- **To Guided Mode**: Say "I'd like more guidance on this step" or "Can you explain this process?"
- **To Freehand Mode**: Say "I'm familiar with this, let's move quickly" or "Skip the explanations"

### **Mode Switching Examples**
```
User: "I'm getting confused about cross-references. Can you explain how they work?"
Agent: "Switching to Guided Mode. Let me explain the cross-reference system..."

User: "I understand now. Let's move quickly through the rest."
Agent: "Switching to Freehand Mode. Proceeding with efficient workflow..."
```

## **Quality Standards (Both Modes)**

### **Identical Quality Requirements**
Both modes maintain the same high standards:
- Professional legal formatting
- Proper paragraph numbering (`**1.**` format)
- Correct legal citations (bold statutes, italic cases)
- Valid cross-references
- Court-ready document structure

### **Mode Differences in Quality Assurance**
- **Guided Mode**: Detailed explanations of why standards exist and how to meet them
- **Freehand Mode**: Quick validation feedback and error correction without extensive explanations
