      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">2.</span> <strong>2.</strong> Defendant <strong>HILTON RESORTS CORPORATION</strong> ("Hilton Resorts") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Orlando, Florida. Upon information and belief, Hilton Resorts is registered to do business in the State of Nevada and regularly conducts business in Clark County, Nevada.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">3.</span> <strong>3.</strong> Defendant <strong>HILTON GRAND VACATIONS INC.</strong> ("HGV") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Orlando, Florida. Upon information and belief, HGV is registered to do business in the State of Nevada and regularly conducts business in Clark County, Nevada.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span> <strong>4.</strong> At all times relevant hereto, Defendants operated as a unified enterprise in the development, marketing, sale, and financing of timeshare properties, including the property that is the subject of this action.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span> <strong>5.</strong> Defendants HRC and HGV operated as a single enterprise and HRC acted as the alter ego of HGV. Upon information and belief, there is a unity of interest and ownership between the entities such that their separate personalities no longer exist; they share common officers and business operations; and an injustice would result if the acts of HRC were not attributed to HGV, as HGV controls the policies and practices that led to Plaintiff's harm, including the securitization and foreclosure programs.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">2.</span> <strong>8.</strong> This action arises under both federal and Nevada state law, including but not limited to: a.

The <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act</strong>, <strong></strong>15 U.S.C. § 1681<strong> et seq.</strong>; c.

        <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span> <strong>10.</strong> This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants pursuant to <strong></strong>NRS 14.065<strong></strong> (Nevada's long-arm statute) because Defendants: a. Transacted business within Nevada; b. Contracted to supply services within Nevada; c. Caused tortious injury within Nevada by acts or omissions within Nevada; d.

Entering into contracts with Nevada choice of law and venue provisions; d. Conducting foreclosure proceedings on Nevada real property.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span> <strong>12.</strong> The exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendants is consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

        <span class="paragraph-number">7.</span> <strong>13.</strong> Venue is proper in Clark County, Nevada pursuant to: a. The mandatory venue provision in the Purchase Agreement, which states: "any lawsuit shall be commenced, prosecuted and maintained solely in the state or federal courts in Clark County, Nevada"; b. <strong></strong>NRS 13.020<strong></strong>, as Defendants conduct substantial business activities in Clark County; c. The timeshare property that is the subject of this action is located in Clark County, Nevada.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">1.</span> <strong>15.</strong> This action arises from Defendants' systematic pattern of consumer abuse in connection with the sale, financing, and foreclosure of timeshare properties, including violations of federal consumer protection laws and Nevada state law.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">2.</span> <strong>16.</strong> The misconduct detailed herein spans from February 2021 through the present and encompasses violations of federal lending disclosure requirements, wrongful foreclosure without legal standing, willful violations of federal credit reporting laws, and multiple deceptive trade practices under Nevada law.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">3.</span> <strong>17.</strong> Defendants' conduct was not isolated but represents a systematic approach to consumer exploitation designed to maximize profits while disregarding legal requirements and consumer rights.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span> <strong>18.</strong> In or around February 2021, Plaintiff was solicited by Defendants to purchase a timeshare interest in property located in Clark County, Nevada.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span> <strong>19.</strong> Defendants acted in a dual capacity as both the seller of the timeshare property and the lender providing financing for the purchase, creating inherent conflicts of interest that were not adequately disclosed to Plaintiff.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span> <strong>20.</strong> On February 20, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a Purchase Agreement with Defendants for the purchase of a timeshare interest (the "Purchase Agreement"), attached hereto as <strong>Exhibit A</strong> and incorporated herein by reference.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">7.</span> <strong>21.</strong> Simultaneously, Defendants provided financing for the purchase through a promissory note in the original principal amount of $17,532.00 at an interest rate of 19.40% per annum (the "Note"), attached hereto as <strong>Exhibit B</strong> and incorporated herein by reference.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">8.</span> <strong>22.</strong> The transaction was secured by a Deed of Trust on the timeshare property (the "Deed of Trust"), attached hereto as <strong>Exhibit C</strong> and incorporated herein by reference.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">9.</span> <strong>23.</strong> The 19.40% interest rate was excessive and resulted from Defendants' conflicted dual role as both seller seeking to maximize sale price and lender setting financing terms, without adequate disclosure of this conflict to Plaintiff.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">10.</span> <strong>24.</strong> Federal law under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (TRID) requires lenders to provide borrowers with a Closing Disclosure at least three business days before loan consummation to allow meaningful review of final loan terms.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">11.</span> <strong>25.</strong> In direct violation of federal law, Defendants issued the Closing Disclosure to Plaintiff on the same day as the loan closing, providing zero business days for review.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">12.</span> <strong>26.</strong> The Closing Disclosure, attached hereto as Exhibit M and incorporated herein by reference, shows both the "Date Issued" and "Closing Date" as February 20, 2021.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">13.</span> <strong>27.</strong> This same-day closing was part of Defendants' high-pressure sales tactics designed to prevent Plaintiff from meaningfully reviewing the loan terms, seeking legal counsel, comparing financing alternatives, or reconsidering the transaction.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">14.</span> <strong>28.</strong> The same-day closing also prevented Plaintiff from understanding the significance of the arbitration clause buried in Section 18(h) of the Purchase Agreement, which waived Plaintiff's constitutional rights to jury trial and court access.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">15.</span> <strong>29.</strong> Upon information and belief, Defendants operate an active and systematic program of securitizing timeshare loans through asset-backed securities trusts known as "Hilton Grand Vacations Trust" series.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">16.</span> <strong>30.</strong> Public records and securities filings demonstrate that Defendants have securitized hundreds of millions of dollars in timeshare loans through multiple trust series, including the Hilton Grand Vacations Trust 2022-2 ($269 million securitization in August 2022), Hilton Grand Vacations Trust 2024-1B (fixed-rate timeshare loans in April 2024), Hilton Grand Vacations Trust 2024-2 (recent securitization in 2024), and Hilton Grand Vacations Trust 2024-3 ($301.9 million asset-backed securities in October 2024).
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">17.</span> <strong>31.</strong> Upon information and belief, Plaintiff's Note was sold, assigned, or transferred to one of these securitized trusts sometime between the loan origination in February 2021 and the foreclosure in September 2023.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">18.</span> <strong>32.</strong> When Defendants sold Plaintiff's Note to a securitized trust, they ceased to be the beneficiary under the Deed of Trust and lost legal standing to initiate foreclosure proceedings.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">19.</span> <strong>33.</strong> Under Nevada law, only the beneficiary of a deed of trust or their authorized agent may initiate foreclosure proceedings, and the deed of trust is merely a security instrument that follows ownership of the underlying promissory note.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">20.</span> <strong>34.</strong> Following the securitization of Plaintiff's Note, Defendants continued to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies representing themselves as the creditor on Plaintiff's account.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">21.</span> <strong>35.</strong> Plaintiff's credit report shows the account name as "HILTONRESORTSCORP/HGV," reflecting confusion about the actual creditor and suggesting internal uncertainty about which entity had authority to report on the account.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">22.</span> <strong>36.</strong> Defendants' continued reporting as the creditor after securitization constituted willful violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as Defendants knew or should have known they were no longer the actual creditor.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">23.</span> <strong>37.</strong> Defendants had a duty under <strong>15 U.S.C. § 1681s</strong>-2 to ensure the accuracy of information furnished to credit reporting agencies and to conduct reasonable investigations of disputed information.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">24.</span> <strong>38.</strong> Defendants' violations of the FCRA were willful, demonstrating knowing or reckless disregard of their legal obligations, given their systematic securitization program and corporate knowledge of note transfers.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">25.</span> <strong>39.</strong> In or around September 2023, as reflected on Plaintiff's credit report, Defendants initiated foreclosure proceedings against Plaintiff's timeshare property.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">26.</span> <strong>40.</strong> At the time of foreclosure, Defendants lacked legal standing to foreclose because they no longer owned Plaintiff's Note, having previously sold it to a securitized trust.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">27.</span> <strong>41.</strong> Defendants failed to produce the original Note with proper endorsements or demonstrate an unbroken chain of assignments establishing their authority to foreclose.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">28.</span> <strong>42.</strong> The foreclosure was wrongful and unauthorized under Nevada law, as Defendants were not the beneficiary under the Deed of Trust at the time of foreclosure.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">29.</span> <strong>43.</strong> Defendants' conduct in proceeding with foreclosure despite their lack of standing was willful and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff's rights, warranting punitive damages.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">30.</span> <strong>44.</strong> Defendants' conduct throughout their relationship with Plaintiff demonstrates a systematic pattern of bad faith dealing and deceptive trade practices that began with high-pressure, same-day closing in violation of federal law, continued with their failure to adequately disclose conflicts arising from their dual role as seller and lender, escalated through the imposition of unconscionable contract terms including a one-sided arbitration clause, persisted through willful violations of federal credit reporting requirements, and culminated in wrongful foreclosure without legal authority.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">31.</span> <strong>45.</strong> This pattern of conduct was designed to maximize Defendants' profits while systematically depriving consumers of their legal rights and protections.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">32.</span> <strong>46.</strong> Defendants' conduct violates multiple federal and state consumer protection laws and constitutes a systematic campaign of consumer abuse.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">33.</span> <strong>47.</strong> The Purchase Agreement contains an arbitration clause in Section 18(h) that is procedurally and substantively unconscionable under Nevada law.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">34.</span> <strong>48.</strong> The arbitration clause is procedurally unconscionable because it was imposed through a contract of adhesion with no opportunity for negotiation, buried in dense contractual text without prominence, and presented during a high-pressure, same-day closing that prevented meaningful review.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">35.</span> <strong>49.</strong> The arbitration clause is substantively unconscionable because it contains a "foreclosure carve-out" that allows Defendants to use the full power of the court system for their primary remedy while forcing consumers into private arbitration for their claims.
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">36.</span> <strong>50.</strong> Specifically, the clause states that arbitration applies to "any dispute, except a foreclosure proceeding," creating a one-sided system that benefits only Defendants.
      </p>

The specific documents proving the sale and assignment of Plaintiff's individual note into a securitized trust are uniquely and exclusively within the possession and control of the Defendants. Plaintiff has alleged a clear pattern and practice of securitization by Defendants, citing publicly available data on their "Hilton Grand Vacations Trust" series of asset-backed securities.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span> <strong>120.</strong> Defendants engaged in multiple deceptive trade practices in violation of NRS Chapter 598, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span> a. <strong>Misrepresentation of Dual Role and Conflicts</strong>: Failing to adequately disclose that Defendants acted as both seller and lender, creating inherent conflicts of interest that resulted in unfavorable terms for Plaintiff, in violation of the duty to deal fairly with consumers;
      </p>
      
      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">7.</span> b. <strong>High-Pressure Sales Tactics</strong>: Using unconscionable commercial practices including same-day closing in violation of federal law to prevent Plaintiff from meaningfully reviewing the transaction or seeking alternative financing;

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">9.</span> d. <strong>Unconscionable Contract Terms</strong>: Including one-sided arbitration provisions with foreclosure carve-outs designed to benefit Defendants while oppressing consumer rights, and imposing excessive interest rates through the conflicted dual role.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">10.</span> <strong>121.</strong> These practices were deceptive because they misled Plaintiff about the true nature of the transaction, the conflicts inherent in Defendants' dual role, and the rights Plaintiff was waiving.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">11.</span> <strong>122.</strong> Defendants' deceptive practices were part of a systematic approach to consumer transactions designed to maximize profits while concealing material information from consumers.

        <span class="paragraph-number">12.</span> <strong>123.</strong> Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendants' representations and omissions in entering into the transaction.

        <span class="paragraph-number">13.</span> <strong>124.</strong> Had Plaintiff been provided with accurate and complete information about Defendants' conflicts, securitization practices, and the true implications of the contract terms, Plaintiff would not have entered into the transaction or would have demanded different terms.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">15.</span> <strong>126.</strong> Defendants' violations of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act were willful and part of a systematic pattern of consumer deception.

      <p class="numbered-paragraph">
        <span class="paragraph-number">16.</span> <strong>127.</strong> Defendants knew or should have known that their practices violated Nevada consumer protection law but continued to engage in such practices for their own financial benefit.

        <span class="paragraph-number">17.</span> <strong>128.</strong> As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' deceptive trade practices, Plaintiff has suffered substantial actual damages including overpayment for the timeshare property due to undisclosed conflicts, excessive interest payments resulting from the conflicted dual role, loss of the property through wrongful foreclosure, damage to credit score and borrowing capacity, and emotional distress and related costs.
