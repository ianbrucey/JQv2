# PARTIES

**1.** {{LABEL:parties_start}}Plaintiff IAN BRUCE ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Lawrenceville, Georgia.

**2.** Defendant **HILTON RESORTS CORPORATION** ("Hilton Resorts") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Orlando, Florida.
Upon information and belief, Hilton Resorts is registered to do business in the State of Nevada and regularly conducts business in Clark County, Nevada.

**3.** Defendant **HILTON GRAND VACATIONS INC.** ("HGV") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Orlando, Florida.
Upon information and belief, HGV is registered to do business in the State of Nevada and regularly conducts business in Clark County, Nevada.

**4.** At all times relevant hereto, Defendants operated as a unified enterprise in the development, marketing, sale,
and financing of timeshare properties, including the property that is the subject of this action.

**5.** Defendants HRC and HGV operated as a single enterprise and HRC acted as the alter ego of HGV.
Upon information and belief, there is a unity of interest and ownership between the entities such that their separate personalities no longer exist; they share common officers and business operations; and an injustice would result if the acts of HRC were not attributed to HGV, as HGV controls the policies and practices that led to Plaintiff's harm, including the securitization and foreclosure programs.

**6.** Defendants are collectively referred to herein as "Hilton" or "Defendants."{{LABEL:parties_end}}
