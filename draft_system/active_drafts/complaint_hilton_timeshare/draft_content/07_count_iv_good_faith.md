# COUNT IV: BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING

## COUNT IV
### BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING
### (NEVADA LAW)

**104.** Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through
102 as if fully set forth herein.

**105.** This claim arises under Nevada common law recognizing an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in
every contract.

### The Contractual Relationship

**106.** The Purchase Agreement, Promissory Note, and Deed of Trust between Plaintiff and Defendants created contractual
relationships governed by Nevada law.

**107.** Nevada law implies in every contract a covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do
anything to deliberately frustrate the other party's performance or deprive the other party of the benefits of the
contract.

**108.** This implied covenant cannot be waived and exists independent of the express terms of the contract.

### Defendants' Systematic Bad Faith Conduct

**109.** Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through a systematic pattern of conduct
designed to frustrate Plaintiff's contractual rights and benefits, including:

   a. **High-Pressure, Illegal Closing Process**: Violating federal TRID requirements at **12 C.F.R.
ยง 1026.19**(f)(1)(ii) by conducting a same-day closing to prevent Plaintiff from meaningfully reviewing the contract terms or seeking legal counsel;

   b.
**Conflicted Dual Role**: Acting as both seller and lender without adequate disclosure of the inherent conflicts of interest, resulting in excessive pricing and unfavorable terms;

   c.
**Unconscionable Contract Terms**: Imposing a one-sided arbitration clause with a foreclosure carve-out that preserved Defendants' access to courts while denying the same to Plaintiff;

   d.
**Securitization Without Notice**: Selling Plaintiff's Note to a securitized trust without notice, thereby transferring Plaintiff's debt obligation to an unknown third party;

   e.
**False Credit Reporting**: Willfully furnishing inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies after securitization, damaging Plaintiff's creditworthiness;

   f.
**Wrongful Foreclosure**: Proceeding with foreclosure despite lacking legal standing after securitization, and refusing to validate the debt when challenged.

### Deliberate Frustration of Contract Benefits

**110.** Defendants' conduct was not merely negligent but deliberately calculated to frustrate Plaintiff's ability to
receive the benefits of the contractual relationship.

**111.** Plaintiff reasonably expected to receive fair dealing in the loan servicing relationship, accurate credit
reporting, and lawful foreclosure procedures if default occurred.

**112.** Defendants deliberately frustrated these reasonable expectations through their systematic pattern of misconduct
designed to maximize their profits while disregarding Plaintiff's contractual rights.

**113.** Defendants' bad faith conduct continued throughout the entire contractual relationship, from the initial
high-pressure closing through the wrongful foreclosure.

### Damages

**114.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
Plaintiff has suffered substantial damages including the loss of the foreclosed property, damage to credit score and
borrowing capacity, overpayment of interest due to the conflicted dual role, emotional distress and anxiety from the
pattern of abuse, and lost opportunities for fair dealing and proper legal process.

**115.** Defendants' willful and malicious breach of the implied covenant warrants an award of punitive damages to deter
similar conduct and protect other consumers.
