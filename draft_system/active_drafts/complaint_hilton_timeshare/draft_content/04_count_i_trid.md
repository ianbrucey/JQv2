# COUNT I: VIOLATION OF TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (TRID)

## COUNT I
### VIOLATION OF TRUTH IN LENDING ACT
### (TILA-RESPA INTEGRATED DISCLOSURE RULE)

**55.** Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 53
as if fully set forth herein.

**56.** This claim arises under the Truth in Lending Act, **15 U.S.C.
§ 1601** et seq., and the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule, **12 C.F.R. § 1026.19**(f).

**57.** Defendants acted as creditors within the meaning of **15 U.S.C. § 1602(g)** and **12 C.F.R.
§ 1026.2**(a)(17) by extending consumer credit secured by real property.

**58.** The transaction between Plaintiff and Defendants constituted a consumer credit transaction secured by real
property within the scope of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule.

**59.** Under **12 C.F.R.
§ 1026.19**(f)(1)(ii), Defendants were required to ensure that Plaintiff received the Closing Disclosure no later than three business days before consummation of the transaction.

**60.** The purpose of this three-business-day waiting period is to provide consumers with adequate time to review the
final loan terms, compare them with earlier estimates, and make informed decisions about proceeding with the
transaction.

**61.** On February 20, 2021, Defendants issued the Closing Disclosure to Plaintiff on the same day as the loan
consummation, providing zero business days for review in direct violation of federal law.

**62.** This same-day disclosure deprived Plaintiff of the federally mandated review period and constituted a willful or
negligent violation of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule.

**63.** Defendants' violation was not a technical or harmless error, but rather part of a high-pressure sales tactic
designed to prevent Plaintiff from meaningfully reviewing the loan terms or seeking alternative financing.

**64.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation, Plaintiff suffered actual damages including the loss
of the opportunity to review and compare final loan terms, the loss of the opportunity to seek alternative financing
with better terms, the loss of the opportunity to negotiate or withdraw from the transaction, and subsequent financial
harm including foreclosure and credit damage.

**65.** Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages under **15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)**(1) in an amount to be proven at trial.

**66.** In the alternative, should this Court find Plaintiff's claim for affirmative damages to be outside the statute of limitations, Plaintiff asserts this violation as a defense in recoupment against the debt Defendants sought to collect through foreclosure.
The damages suffered by Plaintiff due to the TRID violation should be set off against any amount Defendants claim was owed.

**67.** Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs under **15 U.S.C.
§ 1640(a)**(3) as determined by the Court.
