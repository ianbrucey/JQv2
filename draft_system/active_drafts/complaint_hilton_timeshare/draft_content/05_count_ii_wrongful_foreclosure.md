# COUNT II: WRONGFUL FORECLOSURE (NEVADA LAW)

## COUNT II
### WRONGFUL FORECLOSURE
### (NEVADA LAW)

**68.** Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 66
as if fully set forth herein.

**69.** This claim arises under Nevada common law and statutory provisions governing foreclosure of deeds of trust,
including NRS Chapter 107.

**70.** Under Nevada law, only the beneficiary of a deed of trust or their duly authorized agent may initiate
foreclosure proceedings against the secured property.

**71.** The beneficiary is the party entitled to payment under the promissory note, and the deed of trust is merely a
security instrument that follows ownership of the underlying note.

**72.** When a promissory note is sold, assigned, or transferred, the deed of trust follows the note, and the original
lender ceases to be the beneficiary with authority to foreclose.

### The Foreclosure Process

**73.** In or around June 2023, Plaintiff received a Notice of Substitution of Trustee and Notice of Sale indicating
that foreclosure proceedings had been initiated against the property identified as Parcel Number 162-16-401-004.

**74.** The foreclosure was being facilitated by First American Title Insurance Company as the substitute trustee.

**75.** On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff sent a cease and desist letter to First American Title Insurance Company challenging
the foreclosure and demanding that Defendants validate the alleged debt by producing documentary evidence of their
authority to foreclose.

**76.** Despite this challenge, Defendants proceeded with the foreclosure, which was completed in or around September
2023.

### Defendants' Lack of Standing

**77.** At the time of foreclosure, Defendants lacked standing to initiate or complete foreclosure proceedings because
they no longer owned Plaintiff's promissory note.

**78.** As alleged herein, Defendants operate a systematic securitization program through which they sell timeshare
loans to asset-backed securities trusts, including the "Hilton Grand Vacations Trust" series.

**79.** Upon information and belief, Plaintiff's Note was sold, assigned, or transferred to one of these securitized trusts between February 2021 and June 2023, thereby terminating Defendants' status as beneficiary under the Deed of Trust.
The specific documents proving the sale and assignment of Plaintiff's individual note into a securitized trust are uniquely and exclusively within the possession and control of the Defendants.
Plaintiff has alleged a clear pattern and practice of securitization by Defendants, citing publicly available data on their "Hilton Grand Vacations Trust" series of asset-backed securities.
Discovery is therefore essential and appropriate to confirm the specific disposition of Plaintiff's note.

**80.** Defendants failed to produce the original Note with proper endorsements or demonstrate an unbroken chain of
assignments establishing their continued ownership of the Note and authority to foreclose.

**81.** Defendants' inability or refusal to validate the debt when challenged by Plaintiff demonstrates their lack of
standing to foreclose.

### Willful and Wrongful Conduct

**82.** Defendants' conduct in proceeding with foreclosure despite their lack of standing was willful and in reckless
disregard of Plaintiff's rights.

**83.** Defendants knew or should have known that they had securitized Plaintiff's Note and therefore lacked authority
to foreclose, yet they proceeded anyway.

**84.** This conduct constitutes wrongful foreclosure under Nevada law and warrants an award of punitive damages.

### Damages

**85.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' wrongful foreclosure, Plaintiff has suffered substantial damages
including the loss of the fair market value of the foreclosed property, loss of use and enjoyment of the property,
damage to credit score and borrowing capacity, emotional distress and anxiety, and costs and expenses related to
challenging the foreclosure.

**86.** Defendants' willful conduct in foreclosing without proper authority warrants an award of punitive damages to
deter similar misconduct and protect other consumers.
