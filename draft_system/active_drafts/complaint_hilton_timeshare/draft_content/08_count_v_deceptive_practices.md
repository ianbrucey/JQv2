# COUNT V: VIOLATION OF NEVADA DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT

## COUNT V
### VIOLATION OF NEVADA DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT
### (NRS **CHAPTER 598**)

**116.** Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through
114 as if fully set forth herein.

**117.** This claim arises under the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act, NRS Chapter 598, which provides broad
consumer protection against deceptive practices in trade or commerce.

**118.** Defendants engaged in trade or commerce within the meaning of **NRS 598.0903** through the marketing, sale, and
financing of timeshare properties in Nevada.

**119.** Plaintiff is a consumer within the meaning of **NRS 598.0903** who purchased goods and services from Defendants
for personal use.

### Deceptive Trade Practices

**120.** Defendants engaged in multiple deceptive trade practices in violation of NRS Chapter 598, including but not
limited to:

   a.
**Misrepresentation of Dual Role and Conflicts**: Failing to adequately disclose that Defendants acted as both seller and lender, creating inherent conflicts of interest that resulted in unfavorable terms for Plaintiff, in violation of the duty to deal fairly with consumers;

   b.
**High-Pressure Sales Tactics**: Using unconscionable commercial practices including same-day closing in violation of federal law to prevent Plaintiff from meaningfully reviewing the transaction or seeking alternative financing;

   c.
**Concealment of Material Facts**: Failing to disclose Defendants' intent and practice of securitizing timeshare loans, which materially affected Plaintiff's rights and the nature of the ongoing creditor relationship;

   d.
**Unconscionable Contract Terms**: Including one-sided arbitration provisions with foreclosure carve-outs designed to benefit Defendants while oppressing consumer rights, and imposing excessive interest rates through the conflicted dual role.

**121.** These practices were deceptive because they misled Plaintiff about the true nature of the transaction, the
conflicts inherent in Defendants' dual role, and the rights Plaintiff was waiving.

**122.** Defendants' deceptive practices were part of a systematic approach to consumer transactions designed to
maximize profits while concealing material information from consumers.

### Consumer Reliance and Harm

**123.** Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendants' representations and omissions in entering into the transaction.

**124.** Had Plaintiff been provided with accurate and complete information about Defendants' conflicts, securitization
practices, and the true implications of the contract terms, Plaintiff would not have entered into the transaction or
would have demanded different terms.

**125.** Defendants' deceptive practices directly caused Plaintiff to enter into an unfavorable transaction that
ultimately resulted in foreclosure and substantial financial harm.

### Willful Violations

**126.** Defendants' violations of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act were willful and part of a systematic
pattern of consumer deception.

**127.** Defendants knew or should have known that their practices violated Nevada consumer protection law but continued
to engage in such practices for their own financial benefit.

### Damages

**128.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' deceptive trade practices, Plaintiff has suffered substantial
actual damages including overpayment for the timeshare property due to undisclosed conflicts, excessive interest
payments resulting from the conflicted dual role, loss of the property through wrongful foreclosure, damage to credit
score and borrowing capacity, and emotional distress and related costs.

**129.** Under **NRS 598.0999**, Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for Defendants' willful violations of the
Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

**130.** Under **NRS 598.0999**, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs as a prevailing consumer.
