# COUNT III: WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT

## COUNT III
### WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT
### (**15 U.S.C. § 1681n**)

**87.** Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 85
as if fully set forth herein.

**88.** This claim arises under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681** et seq., specifically the provisions governing willful noncompliance, **15 U.S.C. § 1681n**.

**89.** Defendants are "persons" within the meaning of **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681a(b)** and furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies within the meaning of **15 U.S.C. § 1681s**-2.

### Defendants' FCRA Duties

**90.** Under **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681s**-2(a), Defendants had a duty to ensure that information furnished to consumer reporting agencies was accurate and not misleading.

**91.** Under **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681s**-2(b), Defendants had a duty to conduct reasonable investigations of disputed information and to correct or delete inaccurate information.

**92.** These duties are ongoing and continue for as long as Defendants furnish information about a consumer's account
to credit reporting agencies.

### Willful Violations Through Inaccurate Reporting

**93.** Following the securitization of Plaintiff's Note, Defendants were no longer the creditor on Plaintiff's account
but continued to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies representing themselves as the creditor.

**94.** Plaintiff's credit report reflects this inaccurate reporting, showing the account name as
"HILTONRESORTSCORP/HGV," which demonstrates confusion about the actual creditor and reporting authority.

**95.** Defendants' continued reporting as the creditor after securitization was inaccurate and misleading, in violation of **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681s**-2(a).

**96.** This inaccurate reporting occurred on multiple occasions over an extended period, with each report to each
consumer reporting agency constituting a separate violation.

### Willfulness Standard

**97.** Defendants' violations were willful within the meaning of **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681n**, as they acted with knowing or reckless disregard of their FCRA obligations.

**98.** Defendants' willfulness is demonstrated by their systematic securitization program which gave them actual knowledge of when loans were transferred, their corporate policies and procedures for tracking securitized loans, their continued reporting despite having sold the underlying debt, and the dual entity reporting format suggesting internal confusion about creditor status.
The specific documents proving Defendants' knowledge of the securitization of Plaintiff's individual note are uniquely and exclusively within the possession and control of the Defendants.
Discovery is therefore essential and appropriate to confirm Defendants' willful conduct under the FCRA.

**99.** Defendants knew or should have known that they were no longer the creditor on Plaintiff's account, yet they
continued to report as such in reckless disregard of FCRA requirements.

### Pattern of Violations

**100.** Defendants' FCRA violations were not isolated incidents but part of a systematic pattern affecting multiple
consumers whose loans were securitized.

**101.** This pattern demonstrates Defendants' willful disregard for FCRA compliance and their prioritization of
business convenience over consumer protection.

### Damages to Plaintiff

**102.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' willful FCRA violations, Plaintiff has suffered damages
including inaccurate information appearing on credit reports, damage to credit score and creditworthiness, increased
difficulty obtaining credit on favorable terms, emotional distress and anxiety from credit damage, and time and effort
spent addressing inaccurate credit reporting.

**103.** Defendants' willful violations warrant an award of statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees under **15 U.S.C.
§ 1681n**.
