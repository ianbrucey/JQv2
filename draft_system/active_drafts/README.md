# Active Drafts Directory

This directory contains all active legal document drafts organized by document type.

## Standard Folder Structure

Each draft type follows this standardized structure:

```

├── draft_content/           # Organized markdown content sections
├── html_preview/           # Professional HTML previews ready for download
├── research/               # Legal research and supporting materials
├── exhibits/              # Supporting documents and attachments
├── reference_material/    # Templates and reference documents

*"Please set up a new [document_type] draft with the standard folder structure including html_preview folder for downloadable documents."*

- Motions (sanctions, summary judgment, etc.)
- Complaints and amended complaints

## HTML Preview System

Each draft type includes its own `html_preview/` folder containing:
- Professional HTML previews with proper legal formatting
