## **Guided Mode: Educational Components**

### **Legal Concept Explanations**
```
CROSS-REFERENCE SYSTEM:
"The draft_system uses a sophisticated cross-reference system that allows you 
to reference information from one part of your document in another part. 

For example, instead of retyping all the party information in every count, 
you can simply reference the parties section. This ensures consistency and 
makes updates easier.

Here's how it works:
- Labels mark important sections: {{LABEL:parties_start}}
- References point to those sections: {{REF_RANGE:parties_start:parties_end}}
- The system automatically inserts the correct paragraph numbers

This is especially useful in complaints where you 'reallege' previous 
paragraphs in each count."

LEGAL CITATION FORMAT:
"Legal documents require specific citation formats:
- Statutes: **15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1681n** (bold formatting)
- Cases: *Smith v. Jones* (italic formatting)  
- Regulations: 12 C.F.R. ¬ß 1026.19(f) (regular formatting)

This formatting helps judges and attorneys quickly identify the type of 
authority you're citing."

PARAGRAPH NUMBERING:
"Legal documents use numbered paragraphs for easy reference. The draft_system 
requires the **1.** format (bold number with period) because:
- It's the standard format in most courts
- It's easily readable and professional
- It works consistently across all document types
- It integrates properly with the cross-reference system"
```
