# Requirements Analysis: Legal Case File Management

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a legal professional**, I want to select from my existing case files when opening the application, so I can continue working on ongoing cases.

2. **As a legal professional**, I want to create a new case file with a descriptive title when I don't have existing cases, so I can start organizing a new legal matter.

3. **As a legal professional**, I want case titles to be separate from folder names, so I can use descriptive names without filesystem limitations.

4. **As a legal professional**, I want all my case files stored in a dedicated directory, so I have a centralized location for all legal work.

### Secondary User Stories
5. **As a legal professional**, I want to see case metadata (creation date, last modified, case status), so I can quickly identify the right case.

6. **As a legal professional**, I want to organize cases by client, matter type, or date, so I can find cases efficiently.

7. **As a legal professional**, I want to archive or hide completed cases, so my active case list stays manageable.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Case Selection Interface**: Replace Git repository selection with case file selection
- **Case Creation Workflow**: Allow users to create new cases with titles and metadata
- **Case Metadata Management**: Store case titles, descriptions, and metadata separately from folder structure
- **Dedicated Case Directory**: Centralized storage location for all case files
- **Case Workspace Initialization**: Set up proper folder structure for new cases

### Data Requirements
- **Case Metadata Storage**: JSON or database storage for case information
- **Folder Structure**: Standardized directory layout for each case
- **File Organization**: Predefined folders (pleadings, motions, exhibits, correspondence, etc.)

### Interface Requirements
- **Case Selection Screen**: Replace repository selection with case browser
- **Case Creation Modal**: Form for new case details
- **Case Management**: Edit, archive, delete case options
- **Search and Filter**: Find cases by title, client, date, status

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Fast Case Loading**: Case list should load quickly even with many cases
- **Efficient File Operations**: File browsing within cases should be responsive
- **Metadata Caching**: Case information should be cached for quick access

### Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Legal professionals should understand the interface immediately
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Work well on different screen sizes

### Reliability
- **Data Integrity**: Case metadata and files should never be corrupted
- **Backup Considerations**: Easy to backup case files and metadata
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files or corrupted metadata

### Security
- **File Access Control**: Ensure users can only access their authorized cases
- **Metadata Protection**: Case information should be stored securely
- **Audit Trail**: Track case access and modifications

## Technical Constraints

### Existing OpenHands Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based web interface that needs modification
- **Backend**: FastAPI server that handles workspace management
- **File System**: Local file storage with workspace mounting
- **Configuration**: TOML-based configuration system

### Integration Points
- **Workspace Management**: Must integrate with existing workspace selection logic
- **File Browser**: Leverage existing file browsing capabilities
- **Session Management**: Work with current conversation/session system
- **Settings Storage**: Use existing settings storage mechanisms

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. User can see a list of existing case files on application startup
2. User can create a new case file with a title
3. Case files are stored in a dedicated directory with proper structure
4. Case titles are stored separately from folder names
5. Selected case becomes the active workspace

### Enhanced Features (Future Iterations)
1. Case metadata editing and management
2. Search and filtering capabilities
3. Case archiving and organization
4. Import/export functionality
5. Template-based case creation
6. Client and matter type categorization

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Frontend Complexity**: Significant changes to existing repository selection UI
- **Backend Integration**: Modifying workspace management without breaking existing functionality
- **Data Migration**: Handling existing OpenHands configurations and workspaces
- **File System Permissions**: Ensuring proper access to case directories

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Legal professionals adapting to new interface
- **Data Loss**: Risk of losing case files during implementation
- **Performance Issues**: Slow case loading with large numbers of cases

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Build features progressively with testing
- **Backup Systems**: Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms
- **User Testing**: Validate interface with legal professionals
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain compatibility with original OpenHands functionality

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **File System Access**: Reliable local file system for case storage
- **Node.js/React**: Frontend framework dependencies
- **Python/FastAPI**: Backend framework dependencies
- **Database (Optional)**: For advanced metadata storage (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

### Internal Dependencies
- **OpenHands Core**: Workspace management and session handling
- **File Browser**: Existing file browsing and editing capabilities
- **Settings System**: Configuration and user preferences
- **Authentication**: User identification and access control (if multi-user)

## Assumptions

### User Assumptions
- Users are legal professionals familiar with case file organization
- Users prefer descriptive case titles over technical folder names
- Users work primarily with local file storage (not cloud-based initially)
- Users need quick access to recently used cases

### Technical Assumptions
- OpenHands file system access patterns will work for legal documents
- Existing workspace management can be adapted for case files
- React frontend can be modified without major architectural changes
- Local file storage is sufficient for initial implementation

### Business Assumptions
- Single-user deployment initially (multi-user can be added later)
- Legal document types can be standardized into folder structures
- Case metadata requirements are relatively simple initially
- Integration with external legal software is not immediately required
