# Legal Case File Management - Project Planning

## Overview

This project planning folder contains comprehensive documentation for transforming OpenHands from an agentic coding environment into a dedicated legal drafting workspace. The transformation focuses on replacing Git repository selection with legal case file management, enabling legal professionals to organize and work with case files efficiently.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective
Transform OpenHands to provide legal professionals with:
- **Case-centric workspace management** instead of Git repository selection
- **Organized legal document structure** with standardized folder hierarchies
- **AI-assisted legal drafting** within the context of specific cases
- **Metadata management** for case information, clients, and deadlines

### Key Features
1. **Case Selection Interface**: Replace repository selection with case file browser
2. **Case Creation Workflow**: Allow users to create new cases with titles and metadata
3. **Standardized Folder Structure**: Automatic creation of legal document folders
4. **Metadata Management**: Store case titles, client info, and custom fields separately from folder names
5. **Centralized Storage**: Dedicated directory for all legal case files

- [ ] Replace RepositorySelectionForm with CaseSelectionForm
- [ ] Implement case creation modal and form validation
- [ ] Update routing and navigation for case-based URLs
- [ ] Add Redux state management for case data
- [ ] Create responsive design for different screen sizes

### Phase 3: Core Features (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Implement case search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Add case status management (active, archived, completed)
- [ ] Create file browsing within case directories
- [ ] Implement case metadata editing interface
- [ ] Add case templates for different legal practice areas

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)

- [ ] Integrate with external calendar and time tracking

## Key Technical Decisions

### Data Storage
- **JSON files** for metadata storage (simple, portable, version-controllable)
- **File system** for document storage (familiar to legal professionals)
- **SQLite migration path** available for performance scaling

### Architecture Integration
- **Minimal OpenHands core changes** to maintain compatibility
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout and testing
- **Backward compatibility** with existing workspace functionality

### Security Approach
